Feature: Product admin panel
  In order to maintain the products shown on the site
  As an admin
  I need to be able to add/edit/delete products

#  @javascript
#  Scenario: Add a new product
#    Given I am logged in as an admin
#    Given I am on "/admin/products"
#    When I click "New Product"
##    And I wait for the modal to load
#    And I fill in "Name" with "Veloci-chew toy"
#    And I fill in "Price" with "20"
#    And I fill in "Description" with "Have your velociraptor chew on this instead!"
#    And I press "Save"
#    Then I should see "Product created FTW!"
#    And I should see "Veloci-chew toy"
#    # verify that we are the owner of the toy
#    And I should not see "Anonymous"
